> Android App for getting data from a Cisco NSO system

This is a very experimental Android App that can retrieve
some data from a running Cisco NSO system over the RESTCONF
interface.

Mainly it is an exercise in how to build an Android App using
Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

However, with release 0.2.0 it may actually be useful for some people.

A video demo can be found [here](https://youtu.be/HsOm8Tvw75E?si=_nGcllmQeCNrTdbt).
